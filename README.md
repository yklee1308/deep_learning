# Deep Learning for Computer Vision
## Introduction
This repo is a deep-learning framework for computer vision made by Youngkeun Lee.

This project is being developed with the aim of achieving the following features:
- Covering all computer vision tasks where deep learning is applicable.
- Integration and modularization of basic components and tools for efficient architecture.
- Logical and simple expressions for high readability.

## Tasks Supported by Framework
- [Classification](https://github.com/yklee1308/deep_learning_computer_vision/tree/main/classification) : Deep-learning framework for image classfication.
- [Detection](https://github.com/yklee1308/deep_learning_computer_vision/tree/main/classification) : Deep-learning framework for object detection.
